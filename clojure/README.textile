h2. Get Started

First of all, you need clone the codebase from GitHub:

<blockquote>$ git clone git://github.com/gigix/turing_machine.git</blockquote>

In order to build it, you also need install "Leiningen":http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen -- which is pretty easy on my MacBook Pro with MacPorts:

<blockquote>$ sudo port install leiningen</blockquote>

Now you can build the codebase and see if everything works:

<blockquote>$ cd turing_machine/clojure/domain && ./build.sh</blockquote>

You should see <code>turing_machine-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar</code> being packaged, as well as a "tape" being printed as following:

<blockquote>(0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1)</blockquote>

That's the binary form of rational number 1/3 (0.010101...). You just executed a Turing Machine which calculates 1/3 and prints the result to a tape -- actually we only calculate and display the starting 10 squares of the tape, because it's simply impossible to finish the calculation, because it's infinite.

h2. Calculate An Irrational Number

There's another machine lays in <code>machines/an_irrational_number.machine</code>, which calculates an irrational number with following form:

<blockquote>0.01011011101111011111...</blockquote>

You can run this machine with following instruction -- the algorithm is more complicated, so you have to run more steps to see a reasonable shape:

<blockquote>$ java -jar turing_machine-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar machines/an_irrational_number.machine 1000</blockquote>

The starting part of the tape looks like following:

And here's the "source code" (formal name should be "m-configurations", in which "m" stands for "machine") of this machine, which I will explain in more detail in next section:
