This project is about creating implementations of "Turing Machine":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine as described in Alan Turing's famous paper " "On Computable Numbers, With An Application To The Entscheidungsproblem":http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~ctg/classes/lib/canon/turing-compnum.pdf ". 

_(Note: Charles Petzold's book "The Annotated Turing":http://book.douban.com/subject/2330016/ is a good point to understand Turing's paper.)_

The first implementation is with "Clojure":http://www.clojure.org/ . Refer to "corresponding folder":https://github.com/gigix/turing_machine/tree/master/clojure for more detail. The next target might be an iOS implementation with fancy GUI.
